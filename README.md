## Hi ðŸ‘‹ My Name Is Arnav Zek

# Full Stack Dev . 3D Artist . Game Dev . UI/UX Designer

I have created multiple products that people use on a day-to-day basis, such as Paratime.app, a VSCode extension that allows you to see how many hours your friends have coded compared to you, making programming social and fun.

After Paratime, I created Shortbooks, which allows you to write short books online. It is a platform that enables people to learn new skills and knowledge in a fast and structured way.

Recently, I developed CottonChat.com, which helps you find people who want to talk about the same topics. I created it to make it easier to find new friends or love interests with similar interests, fields of work, and beliefs.
