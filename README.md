# Full Stack Dev . 3D Artist . Game Dev . UI/UX Designer

I have created multiple products that people use on a day-to-day basis, such as https://paratime.app, a VSCode extension that allows you to see how many hours your friends have coded compared to you, making programming social and fun.

After Paratime, I created https://shortbooks.app, which allows you to write short books online. It is a platform that enables people to learn new skills and knowledge in a fast and structured way.

Recently, I developed https://cottonchat.com, which helps you find people who want to talk about the same topics. I created it so that people can find new friends or maybe love interest with with similar passions and goals.
